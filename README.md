# Titanic_Survival_Prediction

## Abstract

For each passenger in the test set, Our model will be trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.

## Dataset Used

The data has been split into two groups:

training set ( train.csv )
test set ( test.csv )

The training set should be used to build our Supervised Machine Learning Models. Our model will be based on “features” like passenger's gender, class, etc. We can also use feature engineering to create new features.

## Supervised Machine Learning Models:

Logistic Regression
K Neighbors
SVC Linear
SVC RBF
Gaussian NB
Decision Tree
Random Forest
